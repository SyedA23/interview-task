# Project Name

This project is designed to be fully responsive across devices including **mobile, tablet, and desktop**.

## ðŸ“± Responsiveness Decisions

- **Mobile-First Approach**  
  - The layout was designed starting from small screens (mobile) and scaled up for larger devices.  
  - This ensures good performance and usability on smartphones first.  

- **Flexible Units**  
  - Used relative units (`rem`, `%`, `vh/vw`, `minmax`) instead of fixed `px` for scalability.  
  - Ensures elements adapt to screen resizing without breaking.  

- **Responsive Typography**  
  - Font sizes scale using `clamp()` and `em` for readability across devices.  
  - Line-height adjusted for smaller screens.  

- **Fluid Layouts with CSS Grid & Flexbox**  
  - Flexbox used for aligning navigation, buttons, and content blocks.  
  - CSS Grid applied to sections requiring structured alignment (cards, services, etc.).  

- **Breakpoints**  
  - Common breakpoints used:  
    - `576px` â†’ Small devices (mobile portrait)  
    - `768px` â†’ Tablets  
    - `992px` â†’ Small desktops  
    - `1200px` â†’ Large desktops  

- **Navigation**  
  - Desktop: Horizontal navigation bar.  
  - Mobile: Collapsible hamburger menu.  

- **Images & Media**  
  - Used `max-width: 100%; height: auto;` to make images responsive.  
  - Implemented responsive SVG icons where possible.

## ðŸš€ Improvements Over Default Layouts

- Replaced **px-based fixed sizes** with responsive units for better scalability.  
- Improved **content flow**: stacked layout on mobile, grid layout on larger screens.  
- Added **hover effects only for desktop** to prevent issues on touch devices.  
- Optimized **footer and header** to adjust spacing dynamically.  
- Ensured **buttons and forms** are touch-friendly with larger tap targets.  
- Used **media queries only where necessary**, letting most elements adapt naturally.

## ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements

- Dark/Light mode toggle.  
- Improve performance with responsive images (`<picture>` + `srcset`).  
- Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, semantic tags).  
- Test responsiveness on more device widths (ultra-wide monitors, foldables).

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** for structure.  
- **CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid, Media Queries)** for responsiveness.  
- (Optional) **Tailwind / Bootstrap** if youâ€™re using a framework.
